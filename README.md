# Customer-Web-app
This app runs on Flask

New things for me in this app: Mostly all. First time I make a Web based app. When I started the Assessment, I honestly thought I was delivering nothing 
(I have been coding since early February). Luckily, I was in the middle of CS50 course (lesson 8) and I saw the Flask lesson which put me into building this project. 
I was in fact working in their controlled environment and on Wednesday I saw I needed to change all into my own repository. Had to learn how Github works, 
download desktop VScode, install needed programs including docker, learn how docker works, implement a database and open/close it from Pythonâ€¦
I am happy I made this far. Code is not based on OOP, I noticed this request late and have not been able to see how to effectively use it. Creating a customer 
class with each customer being an object would make it much harder to later check if the intended new customer was not already in recorded.
Anyway, thank you for letting me get this far, I quite enjoyed the journey.
